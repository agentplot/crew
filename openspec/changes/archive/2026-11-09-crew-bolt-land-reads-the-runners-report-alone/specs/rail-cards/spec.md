## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The landing card is posted once the bolt's verification is green
crew SHALL keep one landings card for each kit with a proven bolt waiting on its main, keyed `land/<kit>`, in the name of the partition's main-level ops, posted on the partition's main host. A bolt SHALL be a row that can land once every unit and chore of it has merged, every unit's latest change has been in a batch whose card the user has answered, its verification is green, its head the landing of its work as the runner reports it (merge-gate "A bolt's verification is its work's landing at its head, as the runner reports it alone"), and no fix of it is in flight. Rows SHALL be in the plan's order. The card SHALL ask only for the landing.

#### Scenario: A green bolt
- **WHEN** every unit and chore of bolt `y` of crew has merged, each unit's latest change has been in a batch the user has answered, `y`'s head `abc1234` is the landing of its last unit as the runner reports it, and no other bolt of crew can land
- **THEN** one card keyed `land/crew` is open in swancloud-ops's name, an approve of risk high, naming `y`, its units and chores and `abc1234` green

#### Scenario: Sluice's pull request
- **WHEN** sluice's submission at `y`'s head has pull request #23 on the kit's GitHub
- **THEN** `y`'s row links it, titled as sluice's pull request for `y`'s landing, on the card's face and in its details

#### Scenario: No pull request
- **WHEN** the kit's sluice opens no pull request for a submission
- **THEN** the row carries no link, and says nothing of one

#### Scenario: Two green bolts of one kit
- **WHEN** bolts `y` and `z` of crew both read proven, `y` first in the plan
- **THEN** one card keyed `land/crew` is open in swancloud-ops's name, its rows `y` then `z`, and no card is open under `land/y` or `land/z`

#### Scenario: Bolts of two kits
- **WHEN** bolt `y` of crew and bolt `w` of swancloud both read proven
- **THEN** `land/crew` holds `y`, `land/swancloud` holds `w`, and each is its own card

#### Scenario: A row carries what the bolt's card carried
- **WHEN** bolt `y` of swc-1, holding units `a` and `b` read in batch 7 and chore `c`, reads proven at `abc1234`, the landing of its work there made at 10:02, with pull request #23, main moved two landings since `y` was cut
- **THEN** `y`'s row names swc-1-conductor, `a`, `b` and `c (chore)`, batch 7, `abc1234` green since 10:02, two landings, pull request #23 linked, and `y`'s reading's link

#### Scenario: A second bolt is proven while the card waits
- **WHEN** `land/crew` waits on the user with one row, `y`, and bolt `z` of crew reads proven
- **THEN** the card becomes a list of `y` and `z`, posted following the one it replaces since a card's kind does not change in place, with a change note naming `z`

#### Scenario: A row's head moves while the card waits
- **WHEN** `land/crew` waits on the user as a list of `y` and `z`, and a fix's merge moves `z`'s head to `def5678`
- **THEN** the card is changed in place, its note saying `z`'s head is now `def5678`, and `z`'s row carries its reading of `def5678` and `bolt/z` at `def5678` as what brings its preview up

#### Scenario: A yes frees the team for its next bolt
- **WHEN** swc-1's bolt `y` is a row of `land/crew`, and the last unit of swc-1's other bolt `z` merges with sluice green at its head, and `d` is the next planned bolt of swc-1's kit
- **THEN** `y`'s row says a yes frees swc-1 for `d`

#### Scenario: A fix in flight holds the card
- **WHEN** bolt `y` would read proven, but `fix/y/gap`, started on `y`, has neither merged nor been dropped
- **THEN** `y` has no box on `land/crew`, its row on the card's face says it is held for `fix/y/gap`, and it has a box again once the fix has merged and `y` reads proven

#### Scenario: A landing row before the bolt reads proven
- **WHEN** every unit of bolt `y` has merged and one unit's latest change has not been in a batch
- **THEN** the rail's landing row for crew names `y`, saying it lands once that unit has been in a batch, and `y` is no row of `land/crew`

#### Scenario: A landing row while a batch card waits on the user
- **WHEN** every unit of bolt `y` has merged, its verification is green, and batch 7, whose card the user has not answered, holds a unit's latest change
- **THEN** the rail's landing row for crew names `y`, saying it lands once you have answered batch 7, and `y` is no row of `land/crew` until the user has answered batch 7's card

#### Scenario: A defect noted on the card
- **WHEN** the user sends `land/crew` with a note naming a defect in `y`, and `y`'s conductor runs `crew fix` on `y` in the note's words
- **THEN** `y` loses its box and its row says "held for a fix: <the note>", and it has a box again once `y` reads proven again
